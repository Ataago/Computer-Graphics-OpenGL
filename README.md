Lab Programs VTU

Design, develop, and implement the following programs in C / C++ and OpenGL

1.	Program to display a set of values {fij} as a rectangular mesh.
2.	Program to recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user. 
3.	Program to create a cylinder and a parallel piped by extruding a circle and quadrilateral respectively. Allow the user to specify the circle and quadrilateral.
4.	Program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling algorithm. (Use appropriate data structures.)
5.	Program to implement Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm. 
6.	Program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input line, window for clipping and view port for displaying the clipped image.
7.	Program to draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.
8.	Program to create a house like figure and rotate it about a given fixed point using OpenGL functions. 
9.	Program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment with perspective viewing. Use OpenGL functions. 
10.	Program using OpenGL functions, to draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.
